### Tool Used

I used Lighthouse to check how well my application performs.

### Testing Process

I ran a Lighthouse test on my project to see how fast the app loads and how well the backend responds. I wanted to make sure that the backend isn’t slowing things down and that everything loads smoothly for the user.

### Results

Lighthouse gave a **100% performance score**, which means:

- My backend responses were fast,
- Nothing was blocking or slowing down the page,
- There were no major issues with how the app loads.

### What I Learned

Even though I didn’t need to fix anything, running this test helped me:

- See that my backend is running efficiently,
- Understand how to measure performance in a project,
- Learn how performance tools work and why they’re important.

If I had seen problems, I would have looked into ways to:

- Make the app respond faster,
- Load smaller amounts of data at a time,
- Or avoid doing extra work that isn’t needed when sending data.
