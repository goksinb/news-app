To ensure accessibility, I used semantic HTML elements such as <header>, <main>, and <footer> to structure the page in a meaningful way for screen readers. All form inputs include associated <label> tags with htmlFor attributes to improve usability for assistive technologies. Text content is clearly readable thanks to high-contrast color choices and readable font sizes. Interactive elements like buttons and links are keyboard accessible and have clear text labels. I also avoided using div or span for clickable elements and relied on native elements like <button> and <a>. Additionally, the layout maintains responsiveness and readability across devices, enhancing both usability and SEO.
