This project includes a basic logging system that tracks actions like creating, and deleting articles. It helps me understand when and how many articles are posted each day. The logs store only necessary info like the action type, article ID, and title. No personal user data is collected. This keeps user privacy protected while still allowing useful tracking for development purposes.
