This project includes a basic logging system that tracks actions like creating, viewing, and deleting articles. It helps me understand how the app is used and makes debugging easier. The logs store only necessary info like the action type, article ID, and titleâ€”no personal user data is collected. This keeps user privacy protected while still allowing useful tracking for development purposes.
