This project could face threats like bad form inputs and too many requests. Form validation is important because users might try to submit empty or broken data. To prevent this, I check that the form fields (title, content, author, category) are filled in before saving a new article. This makes sure only complete and correct data is stored. I also use a rate limiter with express-rate-limit to block users who send too many requests in a short time. This helps protect the app from spamming or overloading the server. I don't allow raw access to the database, which adds some safety. I'm also using environment variables to keep sensitive info (like the database URL) private. These steps help make the app more secure and stable.
